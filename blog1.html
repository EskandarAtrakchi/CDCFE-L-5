				        <strong><h2>Market cap of crypto</h2></strong>
						<p>
						The crypto market is way too large to ignore because it is not just Bitcoin anymore, considering more than two and a half-trillion dollars market capitalization and more than 200 million users. <br>
						<a href="https://blog.crypto.com/" target = "_blank"><strong>source: {Crypto.com (1)} click me</strong></a><br>
						
						Bitcoin is important with a value of more than one trillion dollars, on the other side the digital assets ecosystem is much more, such as decentralized applications (dApps) without middlemen, tokens that act as operating systems, stable coins pegged to the value of fiat currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to replace national currencies, and NFTs enabling connections between creators and fans. 
						This all creates a new generation of companies for digital assets exchanging and trading, in this case offering new applications for brand new industries such as finance, supply chain, social media, and gaming. 
						Bitcoin was designed as money, but it is viewed as digital gold since Bitcoin is considered a store of value asset. 
						Ethereum created a platform powered by smart contracts, allowing the development of hundreds of applications that could transform finance, real estate, insurance, and many other industries. Ethereum work like a digital asset enabling applications to be built on, in the future you may use blockchain to unlock your phone; pay for pizza, and even buy a burger!</p>
						
						<h2><p><strong color= "red">But, what is blockchain technology?</strong></h2><br>
						Companies are focusing on leveraging digital assets and the purpose is to create faster, frictionless, and do not require trusted third parties.
						Blockchain is about a new way of computing paradigm - a programmable computer that can access everywhere to anyone owned by millions of users in the globe.

						Digital assets and blockchain are software-eating the world because the basic foundation of software is Hotel booking systems such as Airbnb, Taxi systems such as Uber, online movies such as Netflix, and so many others which are following the revolution of the industry, digital assets represent the blockchain, so the blockchain is the representation of the architectural transformation in how the technology works.
						Anyone on the internet can start from scratch building projects or applications on the blockchain that provides consistency, matchmaking, and trust, this trend is brand new because it has barely started and money is the easiest application that can be built, so bitcoin use case was established here.
						“I think the transformation we're living through right now could be every bit as big as the internet in the 1990s" 
						
						<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-boss-tells-eu-parliament-crypto-and-fintech-could-be-as-disruptive-as-the-internet" target = "_blank"><strong>source: {Gary Gensler (3)} click me</strong></a><br>
						
						Gensler, the chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, basically highlighted that the multi-trillion dollars crypto market as a global asset by mentioning the internet in the 1990s considering that the internet that we are using on our phones every day is equal to Satellite Internet Characteristics.

						“It has no borders or boundaries. It operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.” 
					
						Believers in blockchain technology think that digital assets are the new monetary system that will liberate us from the control of the banks and the governments, on the other hand, non-believers think that blockchain technology can destabilize the financial system and limit the ability of the governments to collect taxes. 
						It is most likely the next wave to be a Decentralized Finance (Defi) codes that build the internet smart contracts, insurance, loans, and much more, just feels super perfect because blockchain is a system of recording information, while crypto is not just a form of the financial system as titles to real-world assets such as NFTs which known as (non-fungible tokens) build as unique digital goods, online collaboration to vote such as digital autonomous organizations or known as DAOs, and much more, and this is most likely to be the trend for the next couples of decades.

					    The cash that we deal with in our daily life has value just because the government says so, otherwise, it is just paper!
					    The concept of cash is perfect because we do not need a third party, for example, buying a burger for 5$ that means   giving 5$ for a burger knowing this transaction is from person to person no need a third party, and the same 5$ cannot be spent twice, but a problem pops up when we try to use money online because cash cannot be used online and third parties will be included to keep tracking the transaction.
						Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that were first created for internet usage, cryptocurrencies are the first digital assets with an actual value that can be transferred over the internet without any third party included.
						Cryptocurrencies are a set of tools that deploy the implementations for blockchain technology usage and reward the entrants who contribute to the set of tools and keep this protocol running, using cryptocurrencies as money for payments tipping is only one specific application of the crypto and blockchain technology.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
						<p><strong>So, we can say</strong> with a $2tn+ market value and 200mn+ users, the digital asset universe is too large to ignore. We believe crypto-based digital assets could form an entirely new asset class. Bitcoin is important with a market value of ~$900bn, but the digital asset ecosystem is so much more: tokens that act like operating systems, decentralized applications (DApps) without middlemen, stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to replace national currencies, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) enabling connections between creators and fans. Venture Capital digital asset/blockchain investments were $17bn+ in 1H/2021, dwarfing last year's $5.5bn. This creates a new generation of companies for digital assets trading, offerings and new applications across industries, including finance, supply chain, gaming and social media..<br>

					   <h2><strong>Central Bank Digital Currencies <em>(CBDCs)</em></strong><br/></h2>
						<p>
						Central bank digital currencies are digital tokens, similar to cryptocurrency, issued by a central bank. They are pegged to the value of that country's fiat currency.
						Many countries are developing CBDCs, and some have even implemented them into their financial systems. Because so many countries are researching ways to transition to digital currencies, it's important to understand what they are and what they mean to society.

						Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire reiterated his belief that “the U.S. is winning the digital currency space race” in an interview with Yahoo Finance. Circle has the largest U.S.-issued stablecoin with more than 50 billion in circulation, and has supported about $1.7 trillion in transactions over the past year.
						A CBDC needs qualities like transparency, accessibility, and “a standard and technology that people can innovate, without permission,” he said.

                      <p>
					  In the U.S., crypto is considered a digital asset, and the IRS treats it generally like stocks, bonds, and other capital assets. Like these assets, the money you gain from crypto is taxed at different rates, either as capital gains or as income, depending on how you got your crypto and how long you held on to it.

				<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
				       <strong><h2>Simple example to explain why printing money causes inflation</h2></strong><h2>&nbsp;</h2>
					   <p>
						<img  align="right" src="img/gifbiden.gif" style="width:190px; margin-right:4%;"  >
						<ul>
						<li>Suppose the economy produces 1,000 units of output.</li>
						<li>Suppose the money supply (number of notes and coins) = $10,000</li>
						<li>This means that the average price of the output produced will be $10 (10,000/1000)</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						Suppose then that the government print an extra $5,000 notes creating a total money supply of $15,000; but, the output of the economy stays at 1,000 units. Effectively, people have more cash, but, the number of goods is the same. Because people have more cash, they are willing to spend more to buy the goods in the economy.<br>						<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						Ceteris paribus, the price of the 1,000 units will increase to $15 (15,000/1000). The price has increased, but, the quantity of output stays the same. People are not better off, and the value of money has decreased; e.g. A $10 note buys fewer goods than previously.<br>
						<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						<img src="img/tableblog.png" style="width:50%; margin-left:12.5%;">
						<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						Therefore, if the money supply is increased, but, the output stays the same, everything will just become more expensive. The increase in national income will be purely monetary (nominal)<br>
						<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						If output increased by 5%. and the money supply increases by 7%. Then inflation will be roughly 2%.
						<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						<h2>Assumptions in the above example</h2>
						<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						[In the real world, it is possible, if the government printed money, people would just decide to save the extra money and therefore, prices wouldn’t automatically rise. However, to simplify the link between the money supply and inflation, let us assume that consumers are willing to spend the extra money. Also, if you expect inflation to rise, you have an incentive to spend it – rather than see the value of your money fall.]
						<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						<h2>Printing money and devaluation</h2>
						If a country prints money and causes inflation, then, ceteris paribus, the currency will devalue against other currencies.
						<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						
						<img src="img/chartblog.png" style="width:50%; margin-left:25%;"><br>
						<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						For example, the hyperinflation in Germany of 1922-23, caused the German D-Mark to devalue against the currencies that didn’t have inflation.
						The reason is that with the German currency buying fewer goods, you need more German D-Marks to buy the same quantity of US goods.
						<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						<h2>Examples of inflation caused by excess supply of money</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						<img src="img/inflationblog.jpg" style="width:50%; margin-left:25%;">
						<br><h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						<strong>US Confederacy 1861-64.</strong> During the Civil War, the Confederacy printed more paper money. In May 1861, they printed $20 million notes. By the end of 1864, the amount of notes printed had increased to $1 billion. It caused an inflation rate of 700% by April 1864. By the end of the Civil War, the inflation rate was hitting over 5,000% as people lost confidence in the currency.
						<br><h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						<strong>Germany 1922-23.</strong>In 1921 one dollar was worth 90 Marks. By November 1923, the US dollar was worth 4,210,500,000,000 German marks – reflecting the hyperinflation and loss in value of the German currency.
						<br><h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						<h2>Link between money supply and inflation in the real world</h2>
						<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
						The above analysis is something of a simplification. For example, in the real world it is hard to measure the money supply (there are many different measures from M0 narrow money to M4 wide money) Also, in a liquidity trap (recession, different printing money may not cause inflation.<br>
						<em>However,</em> this provides a rough explanation why printing money usually reduces the value of money causing prices to increase.
