</li>
</ol>

<p class="font_8" style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="font_8" style="font-size:14px;">Before deciding to participate in the Cryptocurrency market, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. Most importantly, do not invest money; you cannot afford to lose.</p>

<p class="font_8" style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="font_8" style="font-size:14px;">There is considerable exposure to risk in any crypto exchange transaction, including, but not limited to, leverage, creditworthiness, limited regulatory protection, and market volatility that may substantially affect the price or liquidity of a currency or currency pair.</p>

<p class="font_8" style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="font_8" style="font-size:14px;">Moreover, the leveraged nature of Cryptocurrency trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This decision may work against you as well as for you. The possibility exists that you could sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and be required to deposit additional funds to maintain your position. If you fail to meet any margin requirement, your position may be liquidated, and you will be responsible for any resulting losses. A cryptocurrency (foreign exchange) carries a high-risk level and may not be suitable for all investors. There is a possibility that you may sustain a loss equal to or greater than your entire investment. Therefore, you should not invest or risk money that you cannot afford to lose.&nbsp;</p>
